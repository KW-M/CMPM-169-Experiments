			<h1>Experiment 5 - Our Home</h1>
			<p>
				In this experiment I played with webgl vertex shaders. I initially based it on the <a
					href="https://github.com/aferriss/p5jsShaderExamples/tree/gh-pages/6_3d">P5 Shader 3d Examples</a>,
				especially the displacement texture and normal displacement examples.

			</p>
			<div class=" minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>Originally I tried to use the
					depth buffer to give the computed displacement a nicer SSAO look while maintaining the nice glowing
					effect of simply displaying the normals.
					Later I decided to try the texture displacement with equirectangular textures for the sphere. This
					looked great, but I learned that the p5 sphere generator has a resolution limit that is quite low.
					Instead I used a hi-rez iso sphere from blemder to get better detail from the height map.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p> Combining the Texture displacement with the sinwave based displacement gave an interesting effect.
					By modulating the sin waves based on the terrain of the globe, moutanous regions become more active,
					while the sea became smooth.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>At somepoint I was trying to find ways of mathematically separating areas of the map within the
					vertex shader (while avoiding costly if
					statements). One of the optimizations I tried was using the reverse calculated position
					of each point in the fragment shader to selectively render pixels behind a certain depth. This gave
					the apperance of a hollowed out earth or blob like shapes, vaugely reminicient of landmasses
					(depending on where the cuttof was).
					I liked the look, so I tweeked the depth masks and added a slight depth gradient at the edges, to
					make it look as if the
					blobs of earth are emerging from a black soup or mist. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I enjoyed the aesthetics of this challenge more than the last. Since I had some experience with
					shader writing it was easier to get closer to the results I wanted than with the previous
					experiments, although still challenging and frustrating at times.
				</p>

			<h1>Experiment 5 - Plastic Where!?</h1>
			<p>
				In this experiment I vizualized the <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/microplastics">NOAA
					marine microplastics concentation dataset </a> on a virtual globe.
				The pink dots scattered over the globe reflect the relative concentration of microplastics found in our
				ocean. What's really interesting is how you can see where these microplastics get caught in swirling
				ocean currents, creating zones of high concentation in areas far away from population centers. Areas
				like nort-eastern canada have lots of microplastics, despite almost no plastic being generated nearby.

				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>In this experiment I vizualized the NOAA marine microplastics concentation dataset on an interactive
					globe.
					The challenge here was less in the coding and more in how to get from a csv file of points and
					measurements to a nice looking map. The end result is

				<h2>Integrate</h2>

				<p> I took the weather data into ArcGIS online & ran interpolation over the dataset to get a shaded
					vector map. Then I used the point density vizualization to more cleanly express the relative density
					of microplastics arround the ocean</p>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>After getting the higrez map looking nice, I combined it with the blue marble global imagery from
					NASA in photoshop and tweeked the colors. I used the sphere renederer from experiment 5, but turned
					it inside out and improved the mouse controlls. Finally I paired the texture with some homemade
					twinkle effects in the fragment shader to give it some life.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>My original goal was to use noaa weather data to show wave heights as a displacement map across the
					globe. However it proved to be difficult to get updated swell data in a format that was machine
					readable and easy to turn into a height map. Perhaps the most frustrating parts of this challenge
					were dealing with dataset differences & geographic projection misaligninments.

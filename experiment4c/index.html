			<h1>Experiment 4C - Audio is Video (literally) </h1>
			<p>
			<h4><b>Explainer:</b> WT*?! am I looking at?</h4>
			This experiment was an attempt to see what would happen if you put the output of a 1d fast fourier
			transform as the input to a 2d fast fourier transform using a radar-like
			visualization to
			get the 1d fourier transform into 2d pixels. This turned out to create very unique but rather uninteresting
			noise patters,
			so instead I created a very overcomplecated image effect that trasitions the 2d fourier
			transform of one image into the 2d fourier transform of another image modulated by the 1d fourier
			tranform of the microphone as seen in the left plot. The output on the right is the reverse 2d fourier
			transform of the 2d fast fourier transform seen on the left in the background.
			</p>

				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I began my search with the p5 audio FFT <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.FFT">example</a> and
					mic input <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/sound-mic-input.html">example</a>. plotting the FFT
					result and offsetting it with the waveform
					along a rotating axis gave these cool effects
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p> Next I tried integrating the js 2d fft library from <a
						href="https://github.com/turbomaze/JS-Fourier-Image-Analysis">turbomaze</a>, and got a proof of
					concept going, but unfortunately the computational cost in javascript was too high, and the
					framerate became really bad</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>To get the vizualization running at a live framerate, I switched to writing the code in
					rust and running it using webassembly. The result was very fast and allowed me to finally test the
					end-to end process from microphone through canvas to pixels to inverse 2d FFT to final image output.
					The resulting
					pattern was interesting, slowly shifting and gaining detail like a living soup, but in the end not
					very
					beautiful to a human, especially since I only had one input for both the frequency and phase
					domains. Instead I switched to using the fourier transform of two images and transisitoned between
					them using the green intensity of microphone vizualization. Finally I re-applied the colored audio
					vizualizer to help vizually see where the fft image was
					being updated.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This project was more of personal voyage through many technically challenging topics. As with many
					explorations, the original intent was to find something really unique and interesting, but I
					ultimately came up short. Though the result is interesting, the 2d inverse FFT never produced
					patterns that were very humanly pleasing at a rate fast enough for apreciation. Only by sitting back
					and watching, could I get lost in the s. Switching to known images partially solves this as it gives
					viewers something inmediately recongnizable to start to grasp.

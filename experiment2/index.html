				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I began my search with the rotating shape shader p5js example <a
						href="https://editor.p5js.org/KW-M/sketches/wdNXkzrkP">found here</a>. That showed how to setup
					a webgl shader context in p5 and create n-sided polygons in GLSL. Then I used the examples from <a
						href="https://editor.p5js.org/p5/sketches/Dom:_Video_Pixels">video pixels</a> and <a
						href="https://p5js.org/examples/3d-shader-using-webcam.html">webcam</a> to get the webcam video
					feed into the shader. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p> By Tying the shape to the movement and press of the mouse I got the shape to feel more alive /
					interesting. I used the alpha channel of the shape to layer, crop and invert the video in
					interesting ways.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>The last thing I discovered kindof accidentaly, which is that in Firefox, the colors past the bounds
					of a webgl texture are just the nearest edge streached into thin lines along x or y. It was fun to
					play around with, but I wanted to tie it into the mouse control scheme. I took some inspiration from
					<a href="https://www.justareflektor.com">www.justareflektor.com</a> and I ended up replicating the
					edge effect by using the x and y "crosshairs" of the mouse position as locations to sample the
					texture
					for the full height and width of the canvas. And clicking blends those lines in a subtractive mode
					with the original video, creating an interesting dark ranbow effect.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was a personal project. I found it cool how easy it was to get the webcam in, but hard to think
					about the math to get the screen space to line up with the canvas and mouse. Also frustratingly,
					using the canvas with a custom shader and drawing normal p5 js shapes doesn't work. Adding a
					seperate offscreen graphics element solves this, but brings the framerate way down. I think I'm
					particularly interested in the GPU shading, despite being harder to think about, because I'm also
					trying to learn parallel programming this quarter, and I wan't to practice that way of thinking.</p>

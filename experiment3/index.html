			<h1>Experiment 2 - Generative Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I was inspired by <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1752310">this</a> open processing
					example of a flow field as well as <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1769288">this</a>
					example of quadtrees. While my implementations ended up completely diffrent than the code examples,
					the visuals share many similarities. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p> By implementing my flow field using p5 vector roatations I can steer each particle relative to the
					flow field. Globally tying this to the mouse position changes how the particles react and weather
					they like to settle in the "hills" or "valleys" or spread farther out. Subrtractively blending a
					white rect over the screen gives a very computationally cheap fade effect that's also conrolled by
					the mouse </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>In my original plan, I wanted to combine the flow field with particle-particle interaction and
					behavior like in <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1678056">Ant Colony</a> or <a
						href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1698016">Artificial Life</a> to do this I used a corse
					grid of cells that act as counters for each color. When a cell contains more colors than a
					threashold, the particles speed up and redestribute. The end result is subtle, but leads to the
					patches and rings of color interspersed with other colors as well as the flashes of grid cells that
					you see.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was a solo project. I really hoped to get some interesting results by combining flow fields with
					per particle interaction behavior.
					getting the flatened grid query system to work well at a high framerate was more difficult than
					expected, so I didn't have the time to test as many rules for the particle interactions as I would
					have liked. That said I think the flow field itself came out beautifully.

			<h1>Experiment 6 - A how-to guide</h1>

			<p>
				In this experiment I played with tracery grammars and ai language models. I was inspired by the <a
					href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXJKdh1KZ0w">Retro Encabulator</a> to make a tracery grammar
				that can
				make formal
				assembly instructions for wacky high-tech sounding devices. I also took a book from the current chatbot
				trend to turn the instructions into a poorly constructed, broken, but sometimes funny informational
				chatbot service using the co:here large language model api.
			</p>
			<h4>* WARNING: IT RARELY MAY GENERATE OFFENSIVE CONTENT. PLEASE DO NOT TREAT REPLIES SERIOUSLY! *
			</h4>
			<div class=" minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>First I took tracery's recursive story examples and applying them to basic assembly instructions. The
					results were good but rarely gramatically correct or remotely sensible. To marginally improve the
					coherence of the instructions I used tracery's state saving features to keep track of which parts
					were used in which steps and resuse the same part names in later sections.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p> I had just finished another tool using co:here AI text for custom recipe generation called <a
						href="https://kw-m.github.io/pantry-chef/">Pantry Chef</a>. I thought it would be fun to feed
					the crude, generated output from tracery into the "smarter" large language model, and ask it to
					explain the device in question. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Having the ai generate responses was fun as it generally made for strange, tanjential, but kind of
					coherent answers explaining all manner of things about these completely made up devices. To put it
					all together I opted for the old chatbot style of having limited questions in button bubbles that
					continue the conversation, except I left the ai hanging, so it always sounds bad in the end, just
					like mid 2010's chatbots were like. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I enjoyed the challenge of writing tracery grammars that are remotely sensible. Although I certainly
					had alot of leway with my topic of choice. Seing how the ai responds is still quite fun, and
					entertaining, and I hope you can enjoy it as well.
